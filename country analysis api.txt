### Foreign Key Analysis:
- In the queries, relationships between **Country**, **Subregion**, and **Region** are evident, particularly with how they are fetched from the `Country-Table`.
- The `CountryRiskData-Table` is queried by **Year** but has no visible relationship with **Region** or **Subregion**.
  
### API Suggestions:
Based on this stored procedure, you could create the following APIs:
1. **GET /countries**
   - Fetch the list of all countries with subregions and regions.
   - Equivalent to the first query in the stored procedure.

2. **GET /regions**
   - Fetch distinct regions (filtering out `NULL` or empty values).
   - Equivalent to the second query.

3. **GET /subregions**
   - Fetch distinct subregions along with their regions.
   - Equivalent to the third query.

4. **GET /years**
   - Fetch distinct years from `CountryRiskData-Table`.
   - Equivalent to the fourth query.

5. **GET /analysts**
   - Fetch distinct analysts with subregions and regions.
   - Equivalent to the fifth query.

### Foreign Key Suggestion:
Given that the queries don’t directly rely on foreign key constraints for **Country**, **Region**, or **Subregion**, it might be possible to skip foreign keys. However, having foreign key constraints ensures data integrity, especially when inserting or updating records.

### Foreign Key Considerations

- **`Country-Table` and `CountryRiskData-Table`**: The primary relationship in this procedure is between `Country-Table` and `CountryRiskData-Table`, based on the `Country` column. It would be logical to enforce a foreign key between these two tables to ensure data integrity, especially since country data is being cross-referenced.

- **`RatingAction-Table`**: Another key relationship is with the `RatingAction-Table`, again based on the `Country` column. This also suggests a foreign key to ensure that any country in the `RatingAction-Table` must exist in the `Country-Table`.

### API Suggestions

Based on this stored procedure, the following APIs could be developed:

1. **GET /country-information/{country}**
   - Retrieves detailed information for a specific country, including:
     - Basic country information.
     - Risk data.
     - Calculated values using several functions.
     - Rating actions for the country.
     - Last updated information.

2. **GET /gdp-data/{country}**
   - Fetches GDP and trade data for a specific country.

3. **GET /rating-actions/{country}**
   - Fetches all rating actions for a specific country, ordered by rating date.

4. **GET /last-updated/{country}**
   - Retrieves the last update date for a country.

These APIs would allow a client to fetch detailed and related information about a specific country, including economic data and risk assessments.

### Foreign Key Considerations

Given the steps involved in this stored procedure, it's crucial to have a **foreign key constraint** between `CountryRiskData-Table` and `Country-Table` on the `Country` column. This ensures that any entry in the `CountryRiskData-Table` is linked to an existing country in the `Country-Table`. Otherwise, there could be orphaned data in the `CountryRiskData-Table` if an entry exists there but not in the `Country-Table`.

If you omit the foreign key constraint, there’s a risk of data inconsistency, which may cause issues later when querying or maintaining the data.

### API Suggestions

1. **POST /countries**
   - Inserts a new country and its risk data for the current and next year.
   - Request body:
     ```json
     {
       "country": "CountryName",
       "showCountry": true
     }
     ```
   - This API would insert the country into the `Country-Table` and two records into the `CountryRiskData-Table` (one for the current year and one for the next year).

2. **GET /countries/lookup**
   - Executes the equivalent of `usp_CRD_LoadLookUpCountries` to retrieve lookup data for countries (including subregions, regions, and years).
   - This could be broken into multiple endpoints:
     - **GET /regions**: Retrieve distinct regions.
     - **GET /subregions**: Retrieve distinct subregions.
     - **GET /years**: Retrieve distinct years from `CountryRiskData-Table`.

### Foreign Key Considerations

In this stored procedure, there's no direct dependency on foreign keys because it only interacts with the `Country-Table`. However, the foreign key constraint on other tables (such as `CountryRiskData-Table` or `RatingAction-Table`) would still be useful for maintaining data integrity across the system.

For this specific query, there is no need for a foreign key as it’s just fetching a value based on a condition. However, keeping foreign key constraints in other places would ensure that the country being fetched is consistently linked to other data in the system.

### API Suggestion

1. **GET /countries/{country}**
   - Retrieves a specific country from the `Country-Table` based on the provided country name.
   - Request parameter: `country` (e.g., `/countries/USA`)
   - Example response:
     ```json
     {
       "country": "USA"
     }
     ```

This would be a basic lookup API for fetching a single country.

### Foreign Key Considerations

- **Foreign Key for `Country`:** It would be beneficial to enforce a foreign key on the `Country` field to ensure that updates only apply to valid countries. This will help maintain integrity between related tables, such as `CountryRiskData_Table` and `RatingAction_Table`, where the `Country` column might be referenced.
  
- **Related Tables:** Since this stored procedure only modifies `Country-Table`, foreign keys related to other tables (like `CountryRiskData_Table`) aren’t directly involved here, but maintaining foreign key integrity across the entire schema will help ensure consistent updates.

### API Suggestion

1. **PUT /countries/{country}**
   - **Description:** Updates the information for a given country.
   - **Request Parameters:**
     - `country`: Country name (e.g., `/countries/USA`)
     - JSON body with the following fields:
       - `ISOA3Code`
       - `ISOA2Code`
       - `Region`
       - `SubRegion`
       - `ReviewClass`
       - `Currency`
       - `CurrencyCode`
       - `ShowCountry`
       - `DevelopmentClassification`
       - `FinancialCenter`
       - `SubSovereign`
       - `Sovereign`
       - `LastReview`
       - `NextReview`
       - `CurrentCRR`
       - `CurrentCRROutlook`
       - `ProposedCRR`
       - `ProposedCRROutlook`
       - `RatingComment`
       - `Analyst`
       - `2005FXRate`
       - `Multilateral`
       - `Developing`
   - **Response Example:**
     ```json
     {
       "status": "success",
       "lastUpdatedOn": "2024-10-14T12:34:56"
     }
     ```

### Concurrency Management
- The stored procedure already handles concurrency by updating the `LastUpdatedOn` column. This can be leveraged in the API to ensure that no stale data is updated by incorporating optimistic concurrency checks.

### Foreign Key Considerations

- **Foreign Key for `Country`:** It's important to maintain a foreign key constraint on the `Country` column in the `RatingAction-Table` and `CountryRiskData-Table`. This ensures that the operations performed in this stored procedure only affect valid entries, helping maintain data integrity across the schema.
  
### API Suggestion

1. **POST /ratings/activate**
   - **Description:** Activates proposed ratings for a given country.
   - **Request Body:**
     ```json
     {
       "country": "USA",
       "currentCRR": "A",
       "currentCRROutlook": "Stable",
       "proposedCRR": "AA",
       "proposedCRROutlook": "Positive",
       "ratingComment": "Upgraded due to economic growth."
     }
     ```
   - **Response Example:**
     ```json
     {
       "status": "success",
       "message": "Ratings activated successfully.",
       "lastUpdatedOn": "2024-10-14T12:34:56"
     }
     ```

### Additional Considerations

- **Error Handling:** The procedure’s use of transactions ensures that if any step fails, changes will not be applied, which is crucial for maintaining data consistency.
- **Concurrency Management:** By updating `LastUpdatedOn`, the procedure prepares for concurrency control, making sure that changes reflect the most recent updates.

### Stored Procedure Analysis: `usp_FetchISOCountryDetails`

This stored procedure retrieves ISO country details based on the provided country name. Here’s a breakdown of the key components:

1. **Input Parameter:**
   - The procedure takes a single input parameter `@Country`, which is of type `nvarchar(25)`.

   ```sql
   @Country nvarchar(25)
   ```

2. **SQL Query:**
   - The main query fetches the country name and its corresponding ISO code from the `T_ISO_CountryList` table.

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNTRY, ctcode AS COUNTRY_CODE 
   FROM T_ISO_CountryList 
   WHERE CTCode = (SELECT [Country Mnemonic] as CTCode FROM [Country-Table] WHERE Country = @Country)
   ```

   - Here, it attempts to match the `CTCode` in the `T_ISO_CountryList` with the `Country Mnemonic` obtained from the `Country-Table` for the specified `@Country`.

### Key Points

- **Subquery Usage:**
  - The use of a subquery is intended to match the ISO code (CTCode) for the country specified by `@Country`. If `Country Mnemonic` is not unique, this may lead to issues if multiple rows exist in the `Country-Table`.

- **Error Handling:**
  - The procedure does not currently have error handling. If `@Country` does not exist in `Country-Table`, the subquery would return no rows, potentially causing issues.

### Foreign Key Considerations

- **Foreign Key Relationships:**
  - If you intend to ensure referential integrity between the `T_ISO_CountryList` and the `Country-Table`, it would be prudent to have a foreign key constraint on `CTCode` in `T_ISO_CountryList` referencing `Country Mnemonic` in the `Country-Table`. This ensures that any country being referenced in the `T_ISO_CountryList` is valid according to the `Country-Table`.

### API Suggestion

1. **GET /iso/country-details**
   - **Description:** Fetches ISO details for a given country.
   - **Request Parameters:**
     - `country`: The name of the country.
   - **Response Example:**
     ```json
     {
       "country": "United States",
       "countryCode": "US"
     }
     ```

### Additional Considerations

- **Performance:** Depending on the size of the tables, subqueries can be less efficient than joins. If performance becomes an issue, consider restructuring the query to use a `JOIN` instead.
- **Validation:** Consider implementing validation to check if the `@Country` exists in the `Country-Table` before performing the query to avoid unnecessary subquery execution and potential errors.

### Summary of Foreign Key Recommendations for All Tables:

1. **Country-Table:**
   - Use `Country` as the primary key.

2. **CountryRiskData-Table:**
   - Use `Country` as a foreign key referencing `Country-Table`.

3. **RatingAction-Table:**
   - Use `Country` as a foreign key referencing `Country-Table`.

4. **T_ISO_CountryList:**
   - Consider using `CTCode` as a foreign key referencing `Country Mnemonic` in `Country-Table`.

5. **CountryRegion_Table and CountrySubregion_Table:**
   - Should also reference appropriate tables if they have corresponding relationships.
